# Module 7: Auto Data Quality on Hudi snapshot BigLake tables, powered by Dataplex

This module covers Data Profiling and Auto Data Quality in Dataplex on BigLake tables - which in our case happens to be based on Hudi snapshots.<br>

As part of the Terraform provisioning, we already created a Dataplex "lake" and several "zones" such as raw, curated and product zones.
