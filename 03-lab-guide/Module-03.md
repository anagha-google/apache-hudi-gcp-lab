# Module 4: Create BigQuery external tables on Hudi datasets in your data lake

This lab module introduces Apache Hudi tooling for integrating Hudi tables in a data lake on Cloud Storage into BigQuery as external tables.

## 1. Native Apache Hudi integration tooling for BigQuery

### 1.1. About
Apache Hudi offers a BigQuerySyncTool - a utility that reads Hudi metadata of a Hudi table in Cloud Storage, and creates a BigQuery external table on the same data. This external table is read only and can be queried using BigQuery SQL from the BigQuery UI and other supported BigQuery querying avenues and use BigQuery compute under the hood to execute.

Learn more about the tooling in the [Apache Hudi documentation](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/gcp_bigquery/).
